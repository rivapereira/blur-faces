This is a program I did while applying for an internship. The program needs an input video and it uses dlib and  cv2_imshow to blur the faces shown in the video.
Given with this code is input screen shots (labelled 1,2,3,4,5)  and output shots ( labelled 1-blurred, 2-blurred, 3-blurred, 4-blurred, 5-blurred)
